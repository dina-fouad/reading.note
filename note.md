## REACT

- React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of
reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use
React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler
programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using
Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way
reactive data flow, which reduces the boilerplate and is easier to reason about than
traditional data binding.

### React ─ Features

-  Components − React is all about components. You need to think of everything as
a component. This will help you maintain the code when working on larger scale
projects.
