# ***PROCESS & Design***
1. Make a website should be designed for the
target audience.
2. Create a list
of reasons why people would
be coming to your site.
3. Look at each of the reasons why
people will be visiting your site
and determine what they need to
achieve their goals.
 4. Make a site map and it will
show how those pages can be
grouped.
5. Create a wireframe you can
ensure that all of the information
that needs to be on a page is
included.
6. Organizing and prioritizing
information on a page helps users understand
its importance and what order to read it in.
7. create a visual hierarchy that gets
across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
8. Make a Site navigation to help people to find where they want to go, and
help them understand what your site is about and how it is organized. 


# ***HTML structure***
- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

# ***HTML5 LAYOUT***
- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.


# ***Extra markup***
- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
