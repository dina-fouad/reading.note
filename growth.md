# ***Growth Mindset***
### When someone has a growth mindset they believe that they can continue to learn and become more intelligent with effort.  In contrast, someone who has a fixed mindset believes that they are born with a certain amount of talent and intelligence and that cannot be improved no matter how much effort they put forth.
