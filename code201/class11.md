## From the Duckett HTML book:
### Images

- You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.

- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.

- You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.

- Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.

- You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.

- To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

### Practical Information
- Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines.

- Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it,and what they do when they get there.

- To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.

- FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.

- Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
