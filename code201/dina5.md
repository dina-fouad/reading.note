## ***Learning to program with JavaScript involves:***
- Understanding some basic
programming concepts and
the terms that JavaScript
programmers use to
describe them.
- Learning the language itself,
and, like all languages, you
need to know its vocabulary
and how to structure your
sentences.
- Becoming familiar with how
it is applied by looking at
examples of how JavaScript
is commonly used in
websites today.

## ***What is the script ?***
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

***To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.***

- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.

- Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.

- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

## ***An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions:***

1- EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE:

***var color = 'beige';***

The value of co 1 or is now beige.

2- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE:

***var area = 3 * 2;***

The value of area is now 6.

## ***Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.***

1- ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
Assign a value to a variable
color = 'beige';

2- COMPARISON OPERATORS
Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se
buy = 3 > 5;
The value of buy is fa 1 se.

3- LOGICAL OPERATORS
Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se
buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);

4- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Perform basic math
area = 3 * 2;

5- STRING OPERATORS
Combine two strings
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';
