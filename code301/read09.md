## Functional Programming Concepts

- What is functional programming?  

Iits a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions also we use it to avoid concepts of shared state, mutable data observed in Object Oriented Programming.

- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects.

- What is immutability? 

It can reduced memory usage, immutability allows you to optimize your application by making use of reference- and value equality. This makes it really easy to see if anything has changed. For example a state change in a react component.

- What is Referential transparency? 

Referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs.

- what is a module?

Module is just essentially another JavaScript file

- What does the word ‘require’ do?

That is in the global object in node js and we can use it any where

- How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

Export it from the module file and then require it at our file

- What do we have to do to make a module available?

Store the required as a variable and export it
