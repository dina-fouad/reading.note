# From the Duckett HTML book:
### ***HTML provides us three different types of lists :***
- Ordered lists `<ol>`
- Unordered lists `<ul>`
- Definition lists `<dl>`

### ***How CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.***
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

### ***An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.***
- Creating an Array:
Example `var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];`
- Access the Elements of an Array
Example
```script
 var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars[0];
```
- Changing an Array Element
Example `cars[0] = "Opel";`
```script
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars[0] = "Opel";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars[0];
```
## Descisions and loops :
- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
