## How to use the Random Module in Python

#### The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.

### When to use it?
#### We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. When making your password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website.

## Random functions
The Random module contains some very useful functions.

## Randint
If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.
```
import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
This will output either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
```

## What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?
The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk. In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

## How to perform Risk Analysis?
There are three steps:

 - Searching the risk

- Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

- Measures for the risk identified
