## Global scope: 
The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

## Local scope:
 The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

 ## Names and Scopes in Python
Since Python is a dynamically-typed language, variables in Python come into existence when you first assign them a value.

## Python Scope vs Namespace
In Python, the concept of scope is closely related to the concept of the namespace. As you’ve learned so far, a Python scope determines where in your program a name is visible. Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects.

## Nested Functions: 
The Enclosing Scope
Enclosing or nonlocal scope is observed when you nest functions inside other functions. The enclosing scope was added in Python 2.2. It takes the form of the local scope of any enclosing function’s local scopes.
